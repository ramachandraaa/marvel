# Task 10: Speed Control of DC Motor Using L298N Driver

### ‚úÖ Objective  
Control the speed of a *5V DC motor* using *Arduino* and the *L298N Motor Driver*.


### ‚ö° Outcome and Learning  
The speed of the DC motor is controlled by varying its input voltage using *Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)*.

- *PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)* adjusts the average voltage applied to the motor by sending a series of ON-OFF pulses.  
- The *Duty Cycle* determines the average voltage:
    - Higher duty cycle ‚Üí Higher average voltage ‚Üí Faster motor speed  
    - Lower duty cycle ‚Üí Lower average voltage ‚Üí Slower motor speed

This experiment helped me understand how PWM controls motor speed in embedded systems using Arduino and motor drivers.

# Task 13: 555 Astable Multivibrator

### ‚úÖ Overview  
The *555 timer IC* is a versatile component used for timing, pulse generation, and oscillator applications.  
In *astable mode*, the 555 timer generates a continuous square wave output without requiring an external trigger.


### ‚ö°Working Principle  
-Pins *2 and 6* are connected together, allowing the circuit to retrigger itself in every cycle, making it a free-running oscillator.  
-The capacitor *C* charges through both resistors *R1 and R2, and discharges only through **R2* (connected to discharge terminal pin 7).

#### ‚è± Timing Calculations:

- *Charge Time*  
 The time required to charge the capacitor is given by the formula:  
  \[
  t_{charge} = 0.693 \times (R1 + R2) \times C
  \]

- *Discharge Time*  The time required to discharge the capacitor is given by the formula:  
  \[
  t_{discharge} = 0.693 \times R2 \times C
  \]

- *Duty Cycle* (Mark-to-Space Ratio):  
  Ratio of resistor R2 to resistor R1, controlling the ON/OFF ratio of the output waveform.



### ‚ö° Outcome  
We attempted the setup multiple times but didn‚Äôt get the correct output initially.  
Finally, we obtained the correct output after swapping the positions of the two capacitors (C2 ‚Üî C3).

# Task 14: Karnaugh Maps and Deriving the Logic Circuit

### ‚úÖ Overview  
A *Karnaugh Map (K-Map)* is a graphical tool used to simplify Boolean algebra expressions.  
It helps in minimizing logical expressions by visually organizing combinations of inputs and outputs.

We considered 4 cases based on the following inputs:
-*Door (D)*: 
  -Locked ‚Üí D = 0  
  -Open ‚Üí D = 1

-*Key (K)*:  
  -Not Pressed ‚Üí K = 0  
  -Pressed ‚Üí K = 1



### üéØ Objective  
Design a *burglar alarm system (output A)* that activates (blinks LED or sounds a buzzer) based on the door and key conditions.


### ‚ö° Approach  
1.Created a *truth table* for all combinations of Door (D) and Key (K), and corresponding Output (A).
2.Constructed the *Karnaugh Map* based on the truth table.
3.Simplified the Boolean expression using the K-Map to derive the minimal logic circuit.



This task enhanced my understanding of logic minimization and designing efficient digital circuits.
