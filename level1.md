## Task 3 – Temperature and Humidity Detection (Embedded)

### Description
Implemented a system using LM35 to monitor temperature and DHT11 to measure both temperature and humidity.  
When the temperature exceeded a threshold, an LED turned ON using a BJT transistor as a switch.  
Data from the DHT11 was displayed on a 16x2 LCD.

### Outcome
- Understood analog and digital sensor interfacing.  
- Implemented threshold-based switching and data display.

### Tools and Components
- LM35 Temperature Sensor  
- DHT11 Sensor  
- BJT Transistor  
- 16x2 LCD  
- ESP32 / Arduino
